With the help of JavaScript, a random topic ic chosen and output to the dev console each time the page is loaded. The webpage contains a list of notes for each topic covered. Building this webpage helped my learn how to use HTML to structure a website, how to use CSS to style a website, and how to use JavaScript to extend the functionality and interactivity of a website. I learned about the git workflow, variables, functions, control flow/conditional logic, loops and more.
